# Exercise Recognition from Wearable Sensors dataset

## Overview 

This data set contains accelerometer and gyroscope recordings from over 200 participants performing various gym exercises.

This data set is described in more detail in the associated manuscript: Morris, D., Saponas, T. S., Guillory, A., & Kelner, I. (2014, April). RecoFit: using a wearable sensor to find, recognize, and count repetitive exercises. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (pp. 3225-3234). ACM.
